# group_similarity_in_array_php
This function helps you to group your data as similarity in array easily. I created it and php doesnt have any native function for this.

Usage is so easy.
It takes 2 parameter. First of them is array that contains data. Second parameter is similarity proportion. Im giving 70% is good i think.
You can change this parameter for your sensitive.
